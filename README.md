# library-survey

This is my first time using HTML-CSS-Javascript. I am trying to make a library survey that carries 6 questions then ends with asking for contact information(email-studentID).
I would like to try and submit this survey into a database maybe using MySQL or something.

I also did use Istanbul Technical University's logo at the top, because i'd like to make it like a university website kinda thing, but of course I am not connected to them in any way.
